## Introduction
This plugin is compatible with Spigot 1.8 and above. After installation, players with the invisibility potion effect will continuously have particle effects appear above their heads while moving.  
If the player has the permission node `invisibleparticle.bypass`, the particle effect will no longer be generated for them.
